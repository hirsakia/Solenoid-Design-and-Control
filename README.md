# Solenoid-Design-and-Control
the goal was to design a solenoid actuator (linear actuator) given force and position performances. ANSYS MAXWELL was used to analyse the electro-magnetic properties of the designed geometry. then MATLAB was implemented was used to design the appropriate controller and to verify nonlinear system performance.
